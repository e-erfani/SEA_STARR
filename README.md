# Post-processing for the LES modeling of the SEASTARR project

### Descriptions:
SEASTARR is a collaborative numerical modeling work to study aerosol-cloud interaction over South-East Atlantic. Multiple international academic groups are involved. Each group conducted various Large Eddy Simulation (LES) experiments. Only the post-processing of LES SAM UW modeling outputs is documented here.

### Authors:
The main post-processing code is developed by Ehsan Erfani.

The codes regarding the conversion to DEPHY format are created by Michael Diamond for NOAA-SAM and are modified by Ehsan Erfani for UW-SAM.

### Codes:
SEASTARR_postprocessing.ipynb: Use LES SAM UW model outputs and perform post-processing analysis

DEPHY_stat.ipynb: Convert SAM stat output to DEPHY standards for SEA STARR

DEPHY_2D.ipynb:   Convert SAM 2D (x-y) output to DEPHY standards for SEA STARR
