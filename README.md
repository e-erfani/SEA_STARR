# Post-processing for the LES modeling of aerosol-cloud interaction over South-East Atlantic for SEASTAR project
The main post-processing code is developed by Ehsan Erfani.
The codes regarding the conversion to DEPHY format is created by Michael Diamond for NOAA-SAM and is modified by Ehsan Erfani for UW-SAM.

### Codes:
SEASTAR_postprocessing.ipynb: Use LES SAM UW model outputs and perform post-processesing analysis

DEPHY_stat.ipynb: Convert SAM stat output to DEPHY standards for SEA STARR

DEPHY_2D.ipynb:   Convert SAM 2D (x-y) output to DEPHY standards for SEA STARR
